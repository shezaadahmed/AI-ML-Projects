# AI-ML-Projects
In this project, we have solved some of the regular problems with the best upcoming solutions using various AI/ML tools such as SciKit Learn Version 1.2.1
# What is Plagiarism?
Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's words, ideas, or work without giving them proper credit or without permission, and presenting it as your own. It is considered a form of academic and intellectual dishonesty, as well as an ethical violation in many contexts, including academia, journalism, publishing, and creative arts. It is an punishable offense in legal and official terms.
# Things to do
Here are some of the things to do in this problem statement.
* Create an text file as much as you want.
* Insert certain content right into the the files.
* Here the best part is that we dont need to cross check and verify if there;s similarity between any of these contents.
* The various AI/ML algorithms helps to analysis the similarities between those text files.
# Tools we used 
We used various tools for different purposes and different executions. We used Winnowing Algorithm that uses bulk document analysis to detect heavy data and it can withstand and process even huge amount of data. 
We've also used Exact Match Algorithm to detect the phrases and sentences each text file has in them.
And when the result pops up, the algorithm will show you how much percent of text similarity is present in different files. 
# Contribution of AI/ML to Modern Problems such as Plagairism and others
Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in plagiarism analysis by automating and enhancing the detection and analysis of potential instances of plagiarism. Here are some key contributions of ML in plagiarism analysis:

   1. Efficient Document Comparison: ML algorithms enable the comparison of documents in an efficient and scalable manner. Instead of manually comparing every document to a database of sources, ML models can automate this process, making it faster and more accurate.

   2. Feature Extraction: ML models can extract relevant features from text, such as word frequency, sentence structure, and n-gram patterns, to identify similarities between documents. These features help in identifying potential instances of plagiarism.

   3. Pattern Recognition: ML algorithms can recognize patterns and similarities between texts, even if they have been paraphrased or reworded. This is crucial because plagiarism can take various forms beyond direct copying.

  4. Customization and Tuning: ML-based plagiarism detection systems can be customized and fine-tuned to suit specific needs and domains. This allows institutions and organizations to adapt plagiarism detection to their unique requirements.

  5.  Cross-Language Plagiarism Detection: ML models can be trained to detect plagiarism across multiple languages, making them versatile tools for detecting plagiarism in diverse content.

  6. Learning from Data: ML models can improve over time by learning from a large dataset of known plagiarism cases. This means that as the system encounters more instances of plagiarism, it becomes better at recognizing new cases.
